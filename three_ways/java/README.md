# Java Three Ways

_Coaching this? Read the coach guidance [here.](https://github.com/makersacademy/slug/blob/main/materials/universe/language_intros/three_ways/java/README.ed.md)_

This module is designed for people who want to learn the Java programming language. By following it, you will:

* Learn to use Java's basic syntax.
* Learn to test-drive simple procedural programming problems using Java.
* Learn to test-drive programs in Java using Object Oriented Programming.
* Learn to test-drive database-backed web applications using Spring, a common web framework for Java.

You will do this through three projects:

1. **Fizzbuzz**
   You will use Java to test-drive a Fizzbuzz program. In this you will learn the rudiments of the language, including how to run code, how to test code, how to use branching and looping logic, and how to call and return values.

2. **Bank**
   You will use Java to test-drive a bank application using Object Oriented Programming. You will learn how to test-drive an application using objects and methods that interact with each other, how to isolate your tests, and how to manage state.

3. **Twitter**
   You will use Java and Spring to test-drive a database-backed web application much like Twitter. You will learn how to build in this framework, how to test drive it, and handle a more realistic degree of debugging and complexity.
