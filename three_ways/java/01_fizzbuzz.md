# Java Three Ways: Fizzbuzz

In this exercise you will test-drive Fizzbuzz. As with all Makers materials you will be expected to learn by doing, by thinking hard, and through independent research. You will be rewarded for your efforts with learning that you can really apply to solve the challenges ahead. Consider this a hiking trail, not a tour bus.

Let's get started.

## Setting up a project

Let's go ahead and set up a new project.

<!-- OMITTED -->

* Install the [IntelliJ IDE](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
* Create a new Gradle Java project. 
* Call it `tryout`.
* Wait for it to download and install the dependencies. This might take a few
  minutes.

## Hello World

Let's begin with a Hello World. Open IntelliJ and create a new Java class. This
is how:

* Go into `src/main/java` in the file tree.
* Right-click on the `java` directory and select `New -> Java Class`
* Ensure `Class` is selected, and type `Main` to give it that name.

It will come with a little bit of sample code. Make it look like this:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
```

That's quite a lot just to print hello world! Don't worry, you'll get the hang
of it. Java intentionally asks you as a programmer to be very explicit in your
programs. For example, you have to say that this `main` method doesn't return
anything by putting `void` before it. This is annoying at first, but you will ‚Äî
I hope ‚Äî come to see how this gives Java its strengths in industry.

More on that later. For now, run it by clicking the little green arrow to the
left of `public static void main` and selecting `Run Main.main()`.

IntelliJ will do some work, and you'll see this in the bottom panel:

```shell
00:00:00: Executing task 'Main.main()'...

> Task :compileJava
> Task :processResources NO-SOURCE
> Task :classes

> Task :Main.main()
Hello, world!

BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2s
2 actionable tasks: 2 executed
18:09:16: Task execution finished 'Main.main()'.
```

Can you spot the "Hello, world!" there? Great! Let's move on.

## Fizzbuzz

Your task is to test-drive a program that takes a max number and returns a string. The string should list out the numbers counting up to and including the given max number, substituting Fizz where the number is divisible by 3, Buzz where it is divisible by 5, and FizzBuzz where it is divisible by both 3 and 5.

Here's an example:

```
CALLING:
  fizzbuzz(15)
SHOULD RETURN:
  "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz"
```

You're going to test drive this, which will be much easier if you avoid printing to the terminal.

Here is a starting point in Java

```java
// For: src/test/java/FizzbuzzTest.java
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;

public class FizzbuzzTest {
    @Test
    void testGenerateListsNumbersUpToOne() {
        Fizzbuzz subject = new Fizzbuzz();
        String result = subject.generate(1);
        assertEquals("1", result);
        // Note that in JUnit, the expected value comes first
        // This is called 'Yoda Conditions'.
    }

//    @Test
//    void testGenerateListsNumbersUpToTwo() {
//        Fizzbuzz subject = new Fizzbuzz();
//        String result = subject.generate(2);
//        assertEquals("1, 2", result);
//    }
}
```

```java
// For: src/main/java/Fizzbuzz.java
public class Fizzbuzz {
    public String generate(Integer upto) {
        return "1";
    }
}
```

You're done when your code passes the following acceptance criteria:

```
CALLING:
  fizzbuzz(100)
SHOULD RETURN:
  "1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, 16, 17, Fizz, 19, Buzz, Fizz, 22, 23, Fizz, Buzz, 26, Fizz, 28, 29, FizzBuzz, 31, 32, Fizz, 34, Buzz, Fizz, 37, 38, Fizz, Buzz, 41, Fizz, 43, 44, FizzBuzz, 46, 47, Fizz, 49, Buzz, Fizz, 52, 53, Fizz, Buzz, 56, Fizz, 58, 59, FizzBuzz, 61, 62, Fizz, 64, Buzz, Fizz, 67, 68, Fizz, Buzz, 71, Fizz, 73, 74, FizzBuzz, 76, 77, Fizz, 79, Buzz, Fizz, 82, 83, Fizz, Buzz, 86, Fizz, 88, 89, FizzBuzz, 91, 92, Fizz, 94, Buzz, Fizz, 97, 98, Fizz, Buzz"
```

### What you'll need to learn

<!-- OMITTED -->

Amongst other things, you'll need to learn:

* [How to write a test using JUnit 5](https://junit.org/junit5/docs/current/user-guide/#writing-tests)
* Java [ifs](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/if.html) and [loops](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/for.html)
* [Java strings](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/data/strings.html)
