# Java Three Ways: Twitter

In this exercise you'll test-drive a Twitter clone. By now you will know the
rudiments of the language and its central paradigm — it's now time to apply it
to a database-backed web application.

We'll use the following stack:

* The Java Language, of course.
* The JUnit5 test framework.
* The Spring Boot web framework.
* The PostgreSQL database.
* The JPA ORM (Object-Relational Mapper, which assists with communication
  between the database and the web application).
* The Thymeleaf view templating system.

Work from the seed application in [twitter_seed/](twitter_seed/) which has all
the above set up for you.

## Features to implement

### To begin

The first two are already set up for you in the seed, including testing.

> As a user  
> So that I can know what website this is  
> I want to see the 'Twitter' heading on the home page

> As a user  
> So that I can let people know what I am doing  
> I want to post a message (tweet) to twitter

> As a user  
> So that I can see what others are saying  
> I want to see all tweets in reverse chronological order

Additional notes:
* You will need to feature test this, and the following features too.
* You don't have to be signed in to see the tweets.

> As a user  
> So that I can better appreciate the context of a twitter  
> I want to see the time at which it was posted

> As a user  
> So that I can post messages on twitter as me  
> I want to sign up for twitter

Additional notes:
* Users sign up with their email, password, name, and a username.
* Tweets should now display the name of the poster and their username.

### To progress

> As a user  
> So that only I can post messages on Twitter as me  
> I want to log in to Twitter

> As a user  
> So that I can avoid others posting messages on Twitter as me  
> I want to log out of Twitter

### To advance

> As a user  
> So that I can have a conversation  
> I want to reply to a tweet from another user

> As a user  
> So that I can clearly read and use the service  
> I want to see a well-designed user interface

Additional notes:
* You may wish to use CSS and Javascript to achieve this.
